# FourScore

Learning new languages is fun.
Comparing them against each other for similar tasks is even funner.

So why not keep writing the same boring game?

Enter Connect Four! Why the name Four Score though? I don't know.

## Requirements?

Not many, honestly..

Each game should accept two players and require unique names, allow for custom
board sizes, and prompt for multiple games, storing all to calculate basic
statistics when the players quit.

Every prompt should verify correct input, and oh - obviously each game must be able to
calculate a winning move in any direction.
