# FourScore

Learning new languages is fun.
So why not keep writing the same boring game as an exercise?

Enter Connect Four! Why the name Four Score though? I don't know.
Who cares about names anyway? I mean, "Facebook", really?

## Requirements?

Not many, honestly..

Each game should accept two players, require unique names, allow for custom board sizes,
verify correct input on every prompt, and oh - obviously each game must be able to
calculate a winning move in any direction.

And the "requirements" keep getting more lax each time...
