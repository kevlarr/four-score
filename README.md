# FourScore

Learning new languages is fun.
So why not keep writing the same boring game as an exercise?

Enter Connect Four! Why the name Four Score though? I don't know.
Who cares about names anyway? I mean, "Facebook", really?

## Requirements?

Not many, honestly..

Each game should accept two players and require unique names, allow for custom
board sizes, and prompt for multiple games, storing all to calculate basic
statistics when the players quit.

Every prompt should verify correct input, and oh - obviously each game must be able to
calculate a winning move in any direction.
